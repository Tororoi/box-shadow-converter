## How to use

Upload an image file and the site will convert the pixels to box shadows, which can be directly copied and pasted into a CSS file. Ideally this is for pixel art such as colorful icons, or other small images. Large images are not recommended, as they will be processed slowly and the length of the box-shadow property will become excessive.
